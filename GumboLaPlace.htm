    THE TOWN THAT MADE ANDOUILLE FAMOUS</font></p>
    <font SIZE="1"><p align="left"></font><font size="2" face="Arial">This recipe takes a
    little while to prepare, but if you take the time to prepare it, you will agree that it is
    well worth your while. Jerry Folse, brother of international celebrity chef, John Folse,
    gave this outstanding gumbo recipe to Jacob&#146;s World Famous Andouille and it was used
    to win the 2003 Andouille Festival Cook-off. Jerry is the two time winner of the Louisiana
    Wild Game and Seafood Cook-off , as well as winner of numerous local cook-offs. His gumbo
    recipes have been featured in the &quot;Southern Living&quot; and in the &quot;Times
    Picayune&quot;. One of his State Wild Game and Seafood Cook-off recipes, Louisiana Seafood
    Sauce Piquant, was entered in a publication called &quot;100 Top Cajun Recipes of All
    Time&quot;, which was published by <b>Acadiana Profile Magazine</b>.</font></p>

    </center></div><p align="left">Remove skin and boil chicken leg quarters with turkey necks
    for about 45 minutes in 5 quarts of water seasoned with a little salt, black pepper, 2 bay
    leaves and about 1/4 each of the garlic, parsley and onions. Remove chicken from stock,
    cool and bone, leaving the turkey necks simmering in the stock. Set boned chicken aside,
    returning bones to stock and continue simmering for about an hour.</p>
    <p align="left">When stock is almost done, make roux (takes about 20 minutes) by combining
    oil and flower in a heavy iron pot over medium heat. Once oil is hot, add flour and stir
    constantly with a metal spatula or wire whisk until roux is golden brown. It is important
    that roux is stirred constantly to avoid scorching. Turn heat down if roux begins to stick
    or scorch. Start over if necessary. Roux may also be purchased from a supermarket or a
    specialty store. Once roux has turned a golden brown, add remainder of onions, garlic,
    bell pepper and celery and cook for about 10 minutes. Continue stirring to avoid sticking.
    Next, strain stock and add it and the oyster liquid to the mixture of roux and vegetables.
    At this point, I also add the remaining bay leaves, 1/2 of the parsley, 1/2 of the green
    onions, the turkey necks and the andouille or smoked sausage. Allow simmering for about
    one hour, and then add boned chicken. Adjust salt and pepper as needed. Continue cooking
    for about 25 minutes, skimming off excess oil, which rises to the top of the pot. Next,
    add shrimp and oysters<em> (optional)</em>, and the rest of the green onions and parsley.
    Ten minutes later add file&#146; powder and remove from heat. If you don&#146;t like or
    can&#146;t get fresh oysters, leave them out. SERVE OVER A BOWL OF STEAMED RICE!</p>
    <p align="left">Good luck. I hope you enjoy cooking this dish as much as I have.</p>
