    Good Andouille</font><br>
    <font FACE="Arial">SOME RULES BY MR. AND MRS. ROUSSEL</p>
    </font></b><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To aid the judges at Riverside Academy&#146;s first
    annual Gumbo Festival in Reserve last year, Mr. and Mrs. Warren Roussel, founders of
    Roussel&#146;s Restaurant in LaPlace, prepared the following rules for Mrs. Rose Boe,
    chairman of the Riverside festival:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Importance of Ingredients:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Chicken should be well cooked and not falling off the bones.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Andouille should be well cooked and a good quality (not fat).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Oysters should not be put into gumbo until gumbo is done. Add
    oysters last to boiling gumbo, bring to a boil and cut fire off.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Color:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The color of gumbo depends on the right color of the roux. If the
    roux is too dark, the gumbo will be too dark. If the roux is too light, the gumbo will
    have an unappetizing color &#150; light.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Seasonings:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be plenty onions, garlic, celery, green onions, and
    parsley.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Thickness:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This depends on the right quantity of flour in making the roux.
    Gumbo should have the consistency of a thin gravy or sauce.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Manner of Serving:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gumbo filé should not be added to the pot of gumbo unless it is
    to be served immediately &#150; it will be ropy. If it is to be served at intervals, add
    ¼ to ½ teaspoon to each plate on top rice, followed by hot gumbo juice.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really the best way to judge gumbo is by the aromas of the
    different seasonings, the pungent and wonderful flavor of the gumbo. We suggest taste,
    aroma and color.</p>
    <i><font SIZE="5"><b><p>Variation</b></font><br>
    (Reprinted from an article by Waverly Root which appeared in November 17, 1971, issue of
    the New York Herald Tribune)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> &quot;For the last hundred years or so, andouille has been a
    slang synonym for a stupid or silly person; someone both tall and unintelligent is
    described as &quot;un grand de pendeur d&#146;andouilles&quot; (a great reacher-down of
    sausage). This phrase has saved the rare word &quot;dependeur&quot; from oblivion; it is
    almost never used otherwise.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its contemptuous character has not discouraged the lighthearted
    makers of Vald&#146;Adol, banded together in the Confraternite des Taste-Andouilles, from
    calling its members &quot;dependeurs&quot; and one of its officers the &quot;grand
    dependeur.&quot; Another popular expression the andouille has given to the French is
    &quot;ficele comme une andouille&quot; (trussed up like a sausage), which describes anyone
    whose clothes are too tight.&quot;<i></p>
    <font SIZE="5"><b><p>Other Uses</b></font></i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer to the question &quot;What in the world do you do with
    andouille except make a gumbo?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mary Duhe &#150; &quot;Use rabbit, squirrel, or duck in andouille
    gumbo instead of chicken. We make a lot of game dishes.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyle Cambre &#150; &quot;Just slice it and eat it. I love it that
    way.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Gerald LaNasa &#150; &quot;Use as a charcoal hors
    d&#146;oeuvre.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrea Bourgeois &#150; &quot;Dip barbecued or plain andouille on
    toothpicks into hot mustard. It&#146;s delicious.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joy Clement &#150; &quot;I fry andouille. Just prick it with a
    fork, add a little water to the pan, and fry until tender.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandra Cortez Boe &#150; &quot;My mother smothers okra down over
    andouille. Sometimes she uses smoked sausage too. It&#146;s really good. And did you ever
    try a &quot;dirty rice&quot; made with andouille?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna Martin &#150; &quot;I&#146;ve eaten okra gumbo with
    andouille. My mother used to cook it that way and it&#146;s good.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donna Melancon &#150; &quot;Once I ate seafood gumbo and it had
    andouille in it too.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of people &#150; &quot;Sauté onions and andouille, then
    smother cabbage down over it.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still others &#150; &quot;Use it with snap beans and new
    potatoes.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waverly Root, renowned food writer &#150; &quot;When andouille is
    served hot, it is usually accompanied by mashed potatoes or warm applesauce.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Picayune Creole Cook Book &#150; &quot;This sausage is
    generally served with mashed potatoes, a puree of peas, or lentils. The chitterlings are
    first boiled in an aromatic water, with an herb bouguet, or in milk; they are then
    broiled, or baked in the oven for eight to ten minutes.&quot;</p>
    <i><b><font size="5"><p>Jambalaya</font></b></i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the German Coast the dish is commonly called &quot;red
    rice&quot; because of its color, and the recipes are as varied as the people who make it.
    This is a &quot;quick&quot; recipe, for hurry-ups or beginners.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3-lb. frying chicken, cut into pieces<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ lb. andouille, sliced into thin &quot;wheels&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 tbsp. vegetable oil<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 cup (1 large) bellpepper<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 cup (1 large) onion<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 clove garlic, minced<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 tsp. salt<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 tsp. Worchestersshire sauce<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ tsp. thyme<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dash Tobasco sauce<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black pepper to taste<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 small can tomato sauce<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2½ cups chicken broth (canned or hot water with cubes)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1½ cups uncooked long grain rice<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown all meat in oil. Remove meat. Sauté pepper, onion and
    garlic over low heat until vegetables are clear. Add seasonings, tomato sauce and broth.
    Simmer 10 minutes. Add rice and meat. Cover and cook over low heat about 25 minutes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fluff rice with a fork and cook uncovered about 5 minutes longer.
    Rice should be full and dry and have absorbed the color of the broth to be right. Add a
    bit more water if needed.</p>
    <font SIZE="5"><i><b><p>26 Tons</b></i></font><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got curious about how much andouille is produced in East St.
    John the Baptist Parish yearly. So we took the estimates of five producers &#150; Three
    Sisters, Nat Jacob, Keating&#146;s Store, Haydel&#146;s Red and White and Diddy Jacob and
    averaged them out.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without giving away any production figures we can tell you they
    produce an average of 53,050 pounds of andouille a year. That is 26 tons and 1050 pounds
    left for snacking. Remember that is only five producers, and only on the East Bank.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But shades of good eating! That&#146;s a lot of gumbo</td>
