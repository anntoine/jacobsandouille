    for Using Andouille</font></b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All recipes given here are for several people because the
    people who cook them often have large families. Do not despair, though. They taste just as
    good made in smaller quantities &#150; or keep deliciously for next day.</p>
    <i><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    </i><p ALIGN="CENTER"><i>CHICKEN-ANDOUILLE GUMBO LA ROSINA<br>
    (From the Justin Wilson Cookbook)</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of his few dishes that isn&#146;t prepared &quot;au
    vin,&quot; the old master of Acadian cookery steps down from the microphone and shows
    everybody how its done.</p>
    <p>1 large stewing chicken<br>
    1 lb. andouille &#150; sliced in ¼ inch slices<br>
    6 large white or yellow onions, chopped<br>
    1 small bunch green onions, cut fine<br>
    1 small bellpepper, chopped<br>
    1 tablespoon chopped celery<br>
    1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley<br>
    1 clove garlic, chopped<br>
    Salt, black pepper and red cayenne pepper<br>
    ¾ cup all purpose flour (for roux)<br>
    1 cup cooking oil<br>
    6 cups hot water</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut up chicken, wash and season with salt and pepper. Heat one
    cup oil in heavy skillet and fry chicken until brown. Remove chicken and put aside. Pour
    remaining oil into large heavy pot, for making roux.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After roux is made, lower heat and add all chopped ingredients,
    except green onions, garlic and parsley. Cover and simmer until onions are clear, stirring
    occasionally.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add sliced andouille and chicken to roux mixture, cover and let
    simmer about one-half hour. Stir often during this process. Keep heat low through this
    point.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add water, garlic, parsley and green onions. You may increase
    heat until mixture begins to boil. Now lower heat to simmer, cover and cook 1½ to two
    hours or until chicken is tender.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This has a lot of liquid and is served on rice, over which ¼
    teaspoon filé has been sprinkled. It&#146;s even better the next day.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <i><p ALIGN="CENTER">GERMAN COAST GUMBO</i></p>
    <p>Sumptuous is the word for thick, rich chicken-andouille-oyster gumbo made locally.</p>
    <p>1 hen, duck, rabbit or squirrel, cut into pieces.<br>
    1 lb. andouille, cut into pieces (large andouille about ¼ to ½ in. thick; small
    andouille ¾ to 1 inch thick)<br>
    1 jar oysters with liquor (oyster &quot;juice,&quot; not bonded)<br>
    3 large onions, chopped<br>
    1 medium sized bellpepper, chopped<br>
    3 stalks celery with some leaves, chopped<br>
    1 small bunch shallots (small green onions), chopped<br>
    About 3 sprigs parsley, chopped<br>
    1 cup cooking oil<br>
    ¾ cup all purpose flour<br>
    1 chicken bouillion cube<br>
    tablespoon Worchestershire sauce<br>
    1 teaspoon basil<br>
    1 tablespoon filé<br>
    Salt, black pepper and red pepper<br>
    1 clove garlic, chopped<br>
    Water</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use very large heavy pot with cover. Heat oil and brown
    chicken. Remove chicken, add flour to oil and brown to golden-brown for roux. Turn down
    heat and add onions, white part of shallots, bellpeppers, stalks of celery, reserving
    leaves of shallots and celery, parsley and garlic. When onions are clear, add chicken (or
    game) and andouille, basil, water to cover all ingredients and bouillion cube.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simmer gumbo until meat is tender &#150; about 1½ to 2 hours.
    Add remaining ingredients, cover again and simmer gently for about 15 more minutes. Do not
    overcook oysters. They should be curling at the edges to taste best. Serve over steamed
    rice and-or with potato salad, just as you would get it locally.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">POTATO SALAD</i></p>
    <p>The only complaint about gumbo? Believe it or not, people claim it doesn&#146;t stick
    to the ribs. Just like Chinese food, an hour later and you&#146;re hungry again. (We
    suspect it is because everybody just enjoys eating it so much they use this as an excuse.)
    Anyway, many people serve it with potato salad to make it more hearty.</p>
    <p>About 3 pound potatoes, washed and boiled in their jackets.<br>
    1 small bellpepper, chopped<br>
    1 small onion, chopped (optional)<br>
    3 medium-sized sweet pickles, chopped<br>
    1 large Kosher dill, chopped<br>
    2 stalks celery, chopped fine<br>
    6 eggs, hard boiled<br>
    1 cup salad dressing or mayonnaise<br>
    1 tablespoon prepared mustard<br>
    1 tsp. black pepper<br>
    Salt and paprika</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove jackets from potatoes and place in large bowl. With
    potato masher, coarsely chopped them. Remove yolks from eggs, place in medium-sized bowl
    and set aside. Chop whites and add to potatoes, along with bellpepper, onion, pickles,
    celery, salt and pepper. Mix well.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mash egg yolks until very fine, add dressing with mustard, some
    paprika, and mix well. Stir through potato mixture thoroughly. Sprinkle paprika over the
    top, cover and chill, if desired. How to eat it? Either as a side dish, or just pour the
    steaming gumbo right over the potato salad. Don&#146;t knock it until you try it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">POTATO STEW</i></p>
    <p>A hearty dish loved by children and husbands alike, this is one of the famous local
    one-dish meals.</p>
    <p>About 3 pounds of potatoes, cut into big squares<br>
    About 1 pound andouille<br>
    3 small or 2 medium-sized onions<br>
    Salt and black pepper<br>
    Enough water to cover ingredients</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cut andouille into slices. Sauté gently in its own fat until
    browned. Add diced potatoes and chopped onions. Stir occasionally until onions are clear.
    Drain off fat. Cover ingredients with water and simmer until potatoes are tender and
    beginning to flake. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve over rice or with French bread and
    tossed salad.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also good made with hot sausage or ham chunks, or a mixture of
    both.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">BARBECUED ANDOUILLE</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something new and different from Marilyn Villaret, who served
    this dish to guests who &quot;didn&#146;t like andouille&quot; and made believers of them
    all.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Boil links of andouille until
    nice and tender. Cool a bit, then cut lengthwise once. Cut into pieces about six inches
    long. Place in shallow baking pan, cover with barbecue sauce and bake about 15 minutes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serve as meat dish, on sandwiches or cut into toothpick-size
    pieces for a party.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you&#146;re a barbecue &quot;purist&quot; just slap the
    andouille onto your grill after boiling. Don&#146;t cut up first though.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And do-o-o yourself a favor &#150; use the small lean andouille
    for this recipe.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER">RED BEANS AND RICE</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louisiana is already famous for its red beans and rice with
    ham, but after you eat them this way you aren&#146;t likely to go back to using any other
    meat.</p>
    <p>1 pound red beans, well-washed<br>
    1 pound small-link andouille, cut into ¾ inch chunks<br>
    1 large onion, chopped<br>
    1 small bellpepper, chopped<br>
    2 stalks celery, with some leaves, chopped<br>
    1 tablespoon parsley, minced<br>
    2 shallots, chopped and green separated from white<br>
    1 clove garlic, minced<br>
    ½ teaspoon basil<br>
    1 teaspoon rosemary leaves, broken up fine<br>
    1 tablespoon Worchestershire sauce (thin, brown kind)<br>
    Red or black pepper and salt to taste<br>
    Enough water to cover beans well</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use fresh beans if you can. If you use dried beans, don&#146;t
    bother to soak them unless you want them especially solid. In large pot with tight cover
    place everything except shallot tops, Worchestershire sauce, parsley, pepper and salt.
    Bring to boil, cover and simmer until beans are tender and beginning to make their own
    sauce. Add water as needed. Add remaining ingredients and simmer, uncovered, about 15
    minutes. Serve over hot steaming rice, following directions on package, with salad and
    French bread.</td>
