    </center></div><p>The popular belief that people in Hong Kong eat only Chop Suey and Chow
    Mein is not completely true.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in that populous city someone eats andouille made by
    Henry &quot;Diddy&quot; Jacob.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong Kong is only one of the many cities worldwide with the
    distinction of being a patron of N. Jacob&#146;s General Merchandise Store in LaPlace.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all began 47 years and about 600 tons, 1,200,000 pounds of
    andouille ago when the late Nelson Jacob acquired Alexander&#146;s Grocery and Saloon. It
    was then he began making and selling andouille along with other &quot;staple&quot; goods.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;To my knowledge we were first in this area to make
    andouille commercially,&quot; Diddy says proudly. &quot;My father (Nelson Jacob) taught me
    how to make the sausage longer ago than I can even remember.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1925 andouille has been made on the premises (which in 1947
    was moved into the old Maurin&#146;s Home Staple Store) one to three times a week. Add
    that to the number of pounds per mixture - 500 to 800 - and you can see that 600 tons is a
    conservative estimate.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diddy admits that there is little difference in the andouille
    made commercially. He uses fresh, lean Boston Butt pork, red pepper, black pepper, salt
    and garlic and, no, he&#146;s not saying how much.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have to protect my interests, just as you could have this
    story copyrighted,&quot; Diddy said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But I&#146;ve never done that and I don&#146;t intend to do
    it now,&quot; we assured him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well then, I&#146;ll never have one of my andouilles
    copyrighted,&quot; he replied, &quot;You understand?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yep&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone knows that peculiarities and the little differences make
    a good thing great.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I smoke my andouille with aged pecan wood,&quot; Diddy
    says, &quot;and add sugar cane, molasses or corn cobs to the fire to give it a sweeter and
    more mellow taste and color.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Another difference is starting the fire with wood chips -
    starter fluids give the sausage a bad taste.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I like to smoke the sausage very slowly - 8 to 14 hours,
    depending on the size of the batch.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything done that naturally and slowly has to be good.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two smokehouses, each with a 650-pound capacity are in the back
    of the store and we can guarantee that they have seen more sausage than &#133;Rowley
    Hymel.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diddy is especially proud that Roussel&#146;s Restaurant is a
    client of his, purchasing about 60 one and one-half to three pound links every week and
    sometimes more.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We suggested that he (Diddy) mail some of his andouille to Red
    China for diplomatic reasons. Anything that good has to have universal appeal.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Heck no,&quot; he said, &quot;once they try it how can I
    make enough to feed 750,000,000 people. We&#146;d probably have to go to war.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yep, that&#146;s true,&quot; we said, &quot;but just think
    - one day we could go into a Chinese restaurant and order sweet and sour andouille,&quot;
    and that seemed a sweet note on which to end our talk. &#150; <i>ELLIS LUCIA</i>.</p>
